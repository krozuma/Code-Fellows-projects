The Amazing Deck Shuffler! is webpage that models an algorithm that shuffles a deck of cards. When the page is loaded the cards are on the left side of the page and are in rank and suit order. A-H stands the ace of hearts and so on. When the click to shuffle button is clicked the program shuffles the deck. After the deck is shuffled, you can click button again to continue shuffling the deck.

The deck shuffler.js code is largely based on code written by Brook Riggio https://github.com/codefellows/c26-deck-o-cards.
